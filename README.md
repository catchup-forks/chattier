## About the email addresses in the seeders

The emails used in the users seeder are all publicly available emails displayed on either GitHub or social media profiles.

The reason I collected and used these emails was because I wanted all of my dummy users to have Gravatar images.

This app is configured to use Mailtrap and will not send any unwanted emails to these accounts.
